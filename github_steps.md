# GitHub Steps

Describe in your own words how to establish a connection between a local repository and a remote repository on GitHub.

Well we have learned two ways so far that I'm aware of.

One way is to clone a repository from github directly to a location in your file system.

The other way is to start a new repository on Github. Create a local source directory and initialize git. Create the file and make initial commit. use git to remotely add the generate SSH from github. Then push the local repository to the github repository whilst setting the main branch. After that git push can just become part of the normal workflow if you want.
